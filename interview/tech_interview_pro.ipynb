    "It's an interview program that TechLead and JomaTech made. They're both YouTubers, have solid content, and well, I love how they're doing their jobs. They both work at FANG companies, and have recent success into getting in them. So I think 500 bucks isn't that much of a rip off. Let's do it.\n",

    "## Cracking the Phone Screen\n",
    "* Know your Resume\n",
    "  * Let your enthusiasm show! It means to be confident when you are over the phone.\n",
    "  * Keep time-management in mind. If you just keep on talking about weird things, they won't have much time to evaluate you.\n",

    "## On-site Process: What to Expect\n",
    "White-boarding is going to be the most important thing because you're a junior level! It'll be mostly about data structures, algorithms, coding, and communication skills. \n",
    "The first and last 5 minutes are your first and last impressions. Which probably is the most important thing. When you ever get into an interview, some interviewers may go straight in, but when you get a little chat, you're problem solving time is going away! You have to manage your time strictly.\n",
    " Of course it'll be essential to actually hone your skills in coding. Once you make a solution, you need to practice finding alternative solutions, also better solutions. Try and think better by optimizing the space and time problem every time when you solve a little problem. There's always going to be more questions, and you'll have to answer them until the time goes off.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Your Axes for Technical Interviews\n",
    "* Coding\n",
    "  * Clean code.\n",
    "* Data Structures & Algorithms\n",
    "* Design\n",
    "  * Big O notations, analyzing with time and space, suggesting alternate solutions.\n",
    "* Communication Skills\n",
    "  * Clear and friendly.\n",
    "* Efficient and Performant\n",
    "  * Yes, time matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Behind the Scenes of a Technical Interview\n",
    "The people mostly get questions from their past experience. Of course they have a question bank in their companies, but most of them have their own special questions, and follow up questions to the end. They could even make new questions at the ground spot. \n",
    " A really important thing to think about is your attitude. Don't be a jerk. I know that people want to look smart and they are smarter than the people who are working at Google. But you shouldn't. You have to play along their game. It's you who want to go work there. They have a lot of choices. You don't. So please, don't be a jerk. \n",
    " Be friendly, speak clearly and nice. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Path to the Onsite (Preparing your resume)\n",
    "Prepare your resume! But the thing is, the \"front door\" is going to be the hardest way to get in. In any way, you must get a referral. It's more important to actually get an interview. Nothing else! And when you ever get to die from the on-site interview, you have to wait for a year to get the job. And yes, you can get referrals from the people you have right now. So I think it'll be fine. \n",
    " Oh yes! When you don't have anyone near you, then just find a recruiter. They are your last hope. So you must tell them that you're qualified with your nice resume and a nice cover letter!\n",
    " I didn't know that open source projects aren't that much of a hustle. It's not that important. Which is pretty cool! It's more about data structures, algorithms, and coding. So I want to make some stuff that can actually do this and that!\n",
    " \n",
    "## Path to the Onsite (Applying for the interview)\n",
    "Rank the companies that you want to go. You won't have high chances if you don't practice with lower companies. The highest companies are going to be hard. The hardest. So you should do better! Practice with all the other companies other than FANG. Find about 20 of them, and find a role that you want to get in. \n",
    " In this way, you can make leverage and get higher compensation. Always use a white board to practice, and learn quickly. \n",

    "* Axis 1: Coding\n",
    "* Axis 2: Data Structures & Algorithms\n",
    "* Axis 3: Design\n",
    "* Axis 4: Communication\n",
    "* Axis: Other Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "## Axis 1: Coding\n",
    "* Understand the job roles.\n",
    "* Understand what 'other' skills can appeal to that company.\n",
    "* Write OOP, SP, FP. You have to show them you know how to write elegant code in the first place.\n",
    "* Speed. Being performant is really important. I think I'm going to go with Python.\n",
    "* Clean Code. Nice method and variable names, with function composition is going to make you win.\n",
    "* Recursion. Recursion is hard. It always comes out, get used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Axis 2: Data Structures & Algorithms\n",
    "* They don't make you use HARD data structures and algorithms. They know how much time you have!\n",
    "* If something is going hard, then you're doing it wrong. Make it simple stupid.\n",
    "* Before thinking about the algorithm, think about what data structure you're going to use to save data.\n",
    "* You need to know stacks, queues, linked lists, hashmaps, arrays, trees, tries, priority queues, graphs, heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Axis 3: Design\n",
    "* Don't code right away. Making the forest first is really important. It also can make the interviewers more easy to evaluate you.\n",
    "* Always do a time/space complexity analysis first. Then you give some solutions, and then get a hint and start coding.\n",
    "* When you think about it, time is the most expensive thing. Space is getting cheaper and cheaper, but when money is the factor, then you go for space. But still, time is way more expensive. Go with that first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Axis 4: Communication\n",
    "The most important thing about communication. I think it's best to make the interview interested. With interesting stories, it's about you. Not your team, your project, or anything else. It's you as an individual which matters. When you tell your story, you have to define what the problems and challenges you encountered. Then you start to tell what kind of things you did and try to explain it as hard as you can so the interviewers can understand your point of context. It's all about clarity.\n",
    " Show them how you can handle cirticism, hard feedback, how you give feedback, saying everything clearly, being nice, all that stuff. Those are what matters. Say it once, and everyone understanding what you said in a really small amount of time. Clearly!\n",
    " \n",
    "## Axis: Other Criteria\n",
    "Time management, being a team player, and showing them you are capable. You have to show them that you're really passionate about code. That's a really important factor of being a coder. If you think about time, then you have to show them that you manage your time efficiently. If you say you're a team player, you have to show that you're independent, get shit done, communicate clearly, listen carefully, and not lazy! "
