    "# Week 1\n",
    "First week of my journey to learning programming languages. I just hope to view programming languages in a great way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start here!\n",
    "Just a few stuff talking about this and that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome! (And Some Course Mechanics)\n",
    "I just got the welcoming and stuff. After this course, I'll most likely be viewing programming languages in a different way. Which will make me write software in many other ways. Also, actually understand the language constructs. What a programming language needs, what a programming language is different from, why that programming language has such feature, how they differentiate from the phylosophy, etc.\n",
    "All the other things were about how the course will be and what materials we have. I didn't really get the homework part, but I think we're going to be doing a huge chunk of it for each week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who I Am / Acknowledgements\n",
    "Just telling who he is and acknowledging the people that made this possible. He certainly travels a lot, has two kids, likes doing activities like biking, hockey, and etc. Maybe I should find a sport quick. I'm dying lol.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the Course is About / Initial Motivation\n",
    "This course mostly focuses on programming language constructs. Also it goes heavily on functional programming. It's pretty easy to say that this course is somewhat of a \"believe me and you'll get it\" course. The lecturer doesn't really defines what exactly we'll be learning. But he says that we'll learn the language features in a whole new way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Background\n",
    "Implementation vs Interface, Recursion. I think I should get a grip on these two first. Since recursion is the most essential parts of functional programming. It actually is the way to use a repeat statement. Pretty much, because everything is a expression in FP. \n",
    "This course is actually for intermediate programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Part A, Part B, Part C\n",
    "He didn't want to do it but it's for everyone to divide it into nice separate pieces. Part A = Part B + Part C. You need everything to proceed. Don't leave things out! It builds on top of everything!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Policy\n",
    "Submit once per day! It's not going to be easy because of the peer-grading system. Not easy to actually get 100%. But well, get an A+ for 95% over! That's what you should aim for. An A+.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Very High-Level Outline\n",
    "* Part A\n",
    "    * Basics, functions, recursions, scope, variables, tuples, lists, ...\n",
    "    * Data types, pattern-matching, tail recursion\n",
    "    * First-class functions, closures\n",
    "    * Type inference, modules\n",
    "* Part B\n",
    "    * Quick \"re-do\" in a dynamically typed language; Delaying evaluation\n",
    "    * Implementing languages with interpreters; Static vs Dynamic typing\n",
    "* Part C\n",
    "    * Dynamically-typed OOP\n",
    "    * OOP vs FP decomposition\n",
    "        * Advanced OOP topics (e.g. mixins, double dispatch)\n",
    "        * Generics vs Subtyping\n"

    "## ML Variable Bindings and Expressions\n",
    "The peices of a programming language. A really important thing! You have to understand the static environment and dynamic environment. Finding out what the types are is the static environment, and doing the evaluation is the dynamic environment. \n",
    " Syntax and Semantics. How to write the various parts of a language is snytax. Semantics tell what those features are. So we need to learn the syntax to know how to write, and then learn the semantics to know what they do.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Rules for Expressions\n",
    "Expressions have three rules to check. The syntax, type-checking, and the evaluation. So you need to know how to write that with the syntax, and how the type checks. And then how it evaluates into a value. After all, evaluation is actually making something into a single value. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The REPL and Errors\n",
    "I learned that in ML you have to use tilda(~) for representing negative numbers and you have to divide with the `div` keyword. Never seen anything like that. Anyways it's cool how we get to see the syntax errors first, and then type-checking, and then evaluation errors! And we use test code to actually check whether the evaluation was right or wrong. So all this is actually a compiling thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shadowing\n",
    "There's no such thing as reassignment in SML. So it just shadows that value and the later one has the real value. I don't really understand how the other values that referenced that value becomes. Is it just caching? Well it feels like that. But still, that's it. It just doesn't do compile time errors because of convenience is what I think.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions Informally\n",
    "So I got to learn how to define functions in SML. What I saw is, there's no return sign. The last thing is the thing that it returns. Also, when it needs more than one parameter, you have to put parantheses! It's so similar to Ruby. But I'm getting a hang on it. Oh and the multiply sign(*) works as a delimiter of function parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions Formally\n",
    "Functions are shown formally with the syntax, type-checking, and evaluation rules. Functions have two states. The definition or binding state, and the call state. Both are different syntaxes since they're different! All I got was that from this video, I should've listened to all the other steps ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pairs and Other Tuples\n",
    "Pairs are just Tuples that have two! Tuples, Triples, etc. The important thing to have here is, Tuples are immutable and they can have multiple types for each item. They can also be nested. The use for tuples generally are for returning more than one value. Not like a list, but a set of values. More than one return values which is a really cool thing to note. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Lists\n",
    "Opposite to tuples, which needs to have the same types for all elements, and it's mutable. In SML there's a lot to know. Just assign it with `[]`, add elements with `::`, get the head or tail with `hd`, `tl`, and check whether the list is empty or not with `null`. All the mentioned syntax are functions, use them well. Also you need to understand how `hd` and `tl` work. Didn't understand the recursive style of getting the element I want lol.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List Functions\n",
    "Functions that manipulate lists. There's wasn't much to see over here except using null and recursion. I think I'll get plenty of questions in the problem set about these. Better get used to recursion lol.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let Expressions\n",
    "The local variable in SML. `let blah in blah end` is the syntax for it. The type checking, well it's the same as returning something. Anything. So it's pretty much a local variable, that makes a new scope of all the calculation and just returns it. It's an expression, but it could look like a function. If it does all this and that of computing instead of a function, it'll be a nice expression. The `val` can do the same as this. But the important thing to remember over here is the introduction of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Functions\n",
    "You can make nested functions with let expressions. The reason nested functions are there are because of its code maintainability and cleanness. You can restrict the scope of that function and use it widely. That's the main purpose of these nested functions. You may have functions that you must use inside a function or method but there will be times that those are only used in there. It's best to use nested functions for these kinds of operations instead of making a utility function that spans across all over the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Let and Efficiency\n",
    "If you do recursions wrong, you're going to do it wrong by exponentionally. So you have to be really careful when you write those kinds of functions. Cache your calculations, obviously it's dynamic programming, and analyze your function with Big(O) notation. It's getting even more important than you think. Let's get on with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Options\n",
    "Optionals! Null pointers will die! Is what they're really trying to do. So the user can know that this function could give an empty value is the real important thing. Something concrete is for the user to decide. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Booleans and Comparison Operations\n",
    "The language actually only needs an ifelse statement. The or, and, ||, && are all just helpers. In SML you use andalso, and orelse for those operations above. The `not` is actually a function over here. For more things to know is, when you do comparisons, both sides must be the same type. If not, you'll get a type-checking error. `=, <>, >, <, <=, >=` for comparison operators. The thing is, you can't use equality(=, <>) operations on real numbers. Real numbers can't be the same in computing(?) so you have to put in some error rates between. A range that you'll accept it to be true! Remember, `<>` is not equal!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of No Mutation\n",
    "We don't need to worry whether the language is actually referring to an alias or a new object! This is something that blew my mind. If you want to append things to a list, you'll have to mutate that list, but in SML, it's not like that. It just aliases it to that value! Which means you don't use much space, and you'll only have that value in the memory. That's how they made it better. But in Java, you have to create a lot of objects and you don't know when they'll change and you have to know whether you're referring to the right object. This is a really important thing to know. Aliasing in SML. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Java Mutation\n",
    "Now this lesson was mind blowing too! In languages that are imperative, that allow mutation, have a big problem when they give aliases(references). It's becuase, references will be always 'mutable'. If you just return a reference of an object, it'll be really easy to just mutate that object! Which is really cool to know. If you don't copy lists, or references that can be mutated, you're going to get hacked. Mutation is this dangerous! But if you're using an immutable language, you're not going to have this problem since mutation doesn't exist. Everything is rather an alias or a new value!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pieces of a Language\n",
    "There are five parts of learning a new language.\n",
    "1. Syntax\n",
    "2. Semantics\n",
    "3. Idioms\n",
    "4. Standard Library\n",
    "5. Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax is just fact based. How to write this and how to write that. \n",
    "From semantics, it's different. You get to know what the syntax you wrote did. How it works in the internals, what it actually does. Idioms is how you actually typical patterns of expressing your computation. How to write this and that in a paradigm. It's either going to be structured programming, object-oriented programming, and functional programming. So we'll mostly get to learn how the language constructs can express that paradigm, idion and what it does when that particular syntax is evaluated. Evaluation rules are semantics.\n"
