# Code
I've been thinking that instead of using NSL, I'd rather make my study notes private.
Instead, I'll put in the code that I studied. 
When I learn a new language, put in the snippets that I might need to understand deeply.
Explain stuff in the comments and test code.
Anything that I learn, that's code, goes in here. NSL is going to get archived.
